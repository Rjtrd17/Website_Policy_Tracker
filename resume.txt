=== POLICY TRACKER: SHARING & STARTUP GUIDE ===

Follow these steps EVERY time you open your PC or start a new session:

1. OPEN TERMINAL:
   - Go to: C:\Users\yash\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\policy-tracker
   - (In PyCharm: Click the 'Terminal' tab at the bottom).

2. START LOCAL SERVER:
   Run this command to start the server:
   python -m http.server 8000

3. FIND YOUR IP ADDRESS (For Local Network Sharing):
   - Open a SECOND terminal window.
   - Run: ipconfig
   - Look for the 'IPv4 Address' (usually starts with 192.168.x.x).

4. PUBLIC SHARING (NGROK):
   If sharing with someone outside your Wi-Fi (e.g., on mobile data):
   - In a NEW terminal, run:
     ngrok http 8000
   - Copy the 'Forwarding' URL (starts with https:// and ends in .ngrok-free.app).

5. ACCESS LINKS:
   - On Your PC: http://localhost:8000/standalone.html
   - On Your Wi-Fi: http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8000/standalone.html
   - Publicly: [NGROK_URL]/standalone.html

IMPORTANT: Keep the terminal windows OPEN. If you close the terminal, the website will stop working.
